## GPT Actions Overview

GPT Actions use Function Calling to make API calls, similar to how ChatGPT's Data Analysis works. The process involves:

1. Determining which API call matches the user's question
2. Creating the necessary JSON input
3. Executing the API call

The system handles authentication automatically and simplifies the process for users - they just ask questions naturally and get natural responses.
