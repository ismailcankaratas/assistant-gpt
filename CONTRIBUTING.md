# Contributing to Assistant GPT

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Assistant GPT as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure your OpenAI API key in the application

## Documentation Updates

When making changes that affect the API or setup process, please update the following files:

- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `docs/api.md` - API documentation
- `docs/setup.md` - Setup and configuration guide

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/ismailcankaratas/assistant-gpt/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ismailcankaratas/assistant-gpt/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Keep line length under 100 characters
* Run `pylint` for style enforcement
* Follow PEP 8 guidelines

## Code Review Guidelines

- All PRs require at least one review
- Ensure code is well-documented
- Include tests for new features
- Follow security best practices
- Handle errors appropriately
